# The courage to be disliked

How to Change Your Life and Achieve Real Happiness

a philosopher who taught that the world was simple and that happiness was within the reach of every man.

## Introduction

people can change, the world is simple and everyone can be happy

That is not because the world is complicated. It's because you are making the world complicated.

The issue is not about how the world is, but about how you are.

### The Unknown Third Giant

a new school of psychology that was established by the Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler at the beginning of the twentieth century.

### Why People Can Change 

Everyone wishes they could change. But why does everyone feel they want to change? There is only one answer: because they cannot change. If it were easy for people to change, they wouldn't spend so much time wishing they could. No matter how much they wish it, people cannot change.

Before an effect, there's a cause.

Who I am now ( the effect ) is determined by occurrences in the past ( causes ).

In Adlerian psychology, we do not think about past "causes" but rather about present "goals".

### Trauma Does Not Exist

No experience is in itself a cause of out success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences-the so-called trauma- but instead we make out of them whatever suits out purposes. We are not determined by out experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.

We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences. Your life is not something that someone gives you , but something you choose yourself, and you are the one who decides how you live.

### How to Live Without Being Controlled by the Past

Regardless of what may have happened in the past, it is the meaning that is attributed to it that determines the way someone's present will be.

We can't go back to the past in a time machine. We can't turn back the hands of time.

People are not driven by past causes but move toward goals that they themselves set

### Socrates and Adler

You should arrive at answers on your own, not rely upon what you get from some else. Answers from others are nothing more than stopgap measures; they're of no value.

### Are You Okay Just As You Are?

The more you read, the more your knowledge increases. But  no matter how much knowledge you gain, your disposition or personality isn't going to basically change.

### Unhappiness Is Something You Choose for Yourself

It's only natural to focus on what you were born with.

Does fixating on what you are born with change the reality? We are not replaceable machines. It is not replacement we need but renewal.

You are unhappy now because you yourself chose being unhappy. Not because you were born under an unlucky star.

### People Always Choose Not to Change

Lifestyle is the tendencies of thought and action in life. In a narrow sense, lifestyle could be defined as someone's personality; taken more broadly, it is a word that encompasses the world view of that person and his or her outlook on life.

Lifestyle is thought of as something that you choose for yourself.

So not only did I choose to be unhappy, but I even went so far as to choose this warped personality, too.

Adlerian psychology is a psychology of courage. Your unhappiness cannot be blamed on your past or your environment. And it isn't that you lack competence. You just lack courage. One might say you are lacking in the courage to be happy.

### Your Life Is Decided Here and Now

People act to achieve some goal or other, instead of being creatures who are driven by causes in their past.

I am unable to change because I myself keep repeatedly making the decision not to change. I don't have enough courage to choose a new lifestyle. In other words, I do not have enough courage to be happy, and that's why I'm unhappy. 

What you should do now is make a decision to stop your current lifestyle. For instance, earlier you said, "If only I could be someone like Y, I'd be happy." As long as you live that way, in the realm of the possibility of "If only such and such were the case," you will never be able to change. Because saying "If only I could be like Y" is an excuse to yourself for not changing.

He wants to live inside that realm of possibilities, where he can say that he could do it if he only had the time, or that he could write if he just had the proper environment, and that he really does have the talent for it. In another five or ten years, he will probably start using other excuses like "I'm not young anymore" or "I've got a family to think about now."

He should just enter his writing for an award, and if he gets rejected, so be it. If he did, he might grow, or discover that he should pursue something different. Either way, he would be able to move on. That is what changing your current lifestyle is about. He won't get anywhere by not submitting anything.

No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on. That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.

## THE SECOND NIGHT: All Problems Are Interpersonal Relationship Problems

People cannot simply forget the past, and neither can they become free from it.

### Why You Dislike Yourself

You notice only your shortcomings because you've resolved to not start liking yourself. In order to not like yourself, you don't see your strong point and focus only on your shortcomings. To you, not liking yourself is a virtue.

It's because you are overly afraid of being disliked by other people and getting hurt in your interpersonal relationships. You're afraid of being treated disparagingly, being refused, and sustaining deep mental wounds. You think that instead of getting entangled in such situations, it would better if you just didn't have relations with anyone in the first place. In other words, your goal is to not get hurt in your relationships with other people.

### All Problems Are Interpersonal Relationship Problems

If one could live in the universe all alone, one's problems would go away.

Whatever the worry that may arise, the shadows of other people always present.

### Feelings of Inferiority Are Subjective Assumptions

When I see a friend who seems happy, before I even feel like celebrating with him, I'm filled with envy and frustration.

It means a feeling of having less worthy. So feeling of inferiority has to do with one's value judgment of oneself.

Ah, that's a felling I know well. That's me in a nutshell. Not a day goes by without me tormenting myself that there's no point in being alive.

### An Inferiority Complex Is an Excuse

Feelings of inferiority are something everyone has. There's nothing bad about feelings of inferiority themselves.

First of all, people enter this world as helpless beings. And people have the universal desire to escape from that helpless state. Adler called this the "pursuit of superiority". The pursuit of superiority and the feeling of inferiority are not diseases but stimulants to normal, healthy striving and growth. If it is not used in th e wrong way, the feeling of inferiority, too, can promote striving and growth.

### Braggarts Have Feelings of Inferiority

The healthiest way is to try to compensate through striving and growth. For instance, it could be by applying oneself to one's studies, engaging in constant training, or being diligent in one's work. However, people who aren't equipped with that courage end up stepping into an inferiority complex. Again, it's thinking, I'm not well educated, so I can't succeed. And it's implying your capability by saying "If only I were well educated, I could be really successful." That "the real," which just happens to be obscured right now by the matter of education, is superior.

In our culture weakness can be quite strong and powerful.

### Life Is Not a Competition

It's enough to just keep moving in a forward direction, without competing with anyone. And, of course, there is no need to compare oneself with others.

A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself to others; it comes from one's comparison with one's ideal self.

Whatever differences we may have, we are all equal.

It does not matter if one is trying to walk in front of others or walk behind them. It is as if we are moving through a flat space that has no vertical axis. We do not walk in order to compete with someone. It is in trying to progress past who one is now that there is value.

### You're the Only One Worrying About Your Appearance

When one is conscious of competition and victory and defeat, it is inevitable that feelings of inferiority will arise. Because one is constantly comparing oneself to others and thinking, I beat that person or I lost to that person. The inferiority complex and the superiority complex are extensions of that. Before I know it, I start to see each and every person, everyone in the whole world, as your enemy.

The person who always has the will to help another in times of need - that is someone who may properly be called your comrade. When you are able to truly feel that "people are my comrades," your way of looking at the world will change utterly. No longer will you think of the world as a perilous place, or be plagued by needless doubts; the world will appear before you as a safe and pleasant place. And your interpersonal relationship problems will decrease dramatically.

### From Power Struggle to Revenge

If you get angry at this point, the moment he has been anticipating will arrive, and the relationship will suddenly turn into a power struggle. No matter what the provocation, you must not get taken in.

Now let's say you take control of the quarrel. And then the other man, who was seeking to defeat you, withdraws in a sportsmanlike manner. The thing is, the power struggle doesn't end there. Having lost the dispute, he rushes on to the next stage. It is  the revenge stage. Though he has withdrawn for the time being, he will be scheming some revenge in another place and another form, and will reappear with an act of retaliation.

### Admitting Fault Is Not Defeat

That you are "bearing it" is proof that you are still stuck in the power struggle. When you are challenged to a fight, and you sense that it is a power struggle, step down from the conflict as soon as possible. Do not answer his action with a reaction. That is the only thing we can do.

When you control your anger, you're "bearing it," right? Instead, let's learn a way to settle things without using the emotion of anger. Because after all, anger is a  tool. A means for achieving a goal.

The first thing that I want you to understand here is the fact that anger is a form of communication, and that communication is nevertheless possible without using anger. We can convey our thoughts and intentions and be accepted without any need for anger. If you learn to understand this experientially, the anger emotion will stop appearing all on its own.

One more thing about power struggles. In every instance, no matter how much you might think you are right, try not to criticize the other party on that basis. This is an interpersonal relationship trap that many people fall into.

The moment one is convinced that "I am right" in an interpersonal relationship, one has already stepped into a power struggle. That is to say, the other party is wrong. At that point, the focus of the discussion shifts from "the rightness of the assertions" to "the state to the interpersonal relationship." In other words, the conviction that "I am right" leads to the assumption that "this person is wrong" and finally it becomes a contest and you are thinking, I have to win. It's a power struggle through and through.

 	In the first place, the rightness of one's assertions has nothing to do with winning or losing. If you think you are right, regardless of what other people's opinions might be, the matter should be closed then and there. However, many people will rush into a power struggle and try to make others submit to them. And that is why they think of "admitting a mistake" as "admitting defeat." Because of one's mind-set of not wanting to lose, one is unable to admit one's mistake, the result being that one ends up choosing the wrong path. Admitting mistakes, conveying words of apology, and stepping down from power struggles - none of these things is defeat. The pursuit of superiority is not something that is carried out through competition with other people.

When you're hung up on winning and losing, you lose the ability to make the right choice. It clouds your judgment, and all you can see is imminent victory or defeat. Then you turn down the wrong path. It's only when we take away the lenses of competition and winning and losing that we can begin to correct and change ourselves.

### Overcoming the Tasks That Face You in Life

Why do you see other people as enemies, and why can't you think of them as your comrades? It is because you have lost your courage and you are running away from your "life tasks."

There are two objectives for behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. Then, the two objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviors are the consciousness that I have the ability and the consciousness that people are my comrades.

### Red String and Rigid Chains

A lot of people think that the more friends you have the better, but I'm not so sure about that. There's no value at all in the number of friends or acquaintances you have. And this a subject that connects with the task of love, but what we should be thinking about is the distance and depth of the relationship.

If you change, those around you will change too. They will have no choice but to change. Adlerian psychology is  psychology for changing oneself, not a psychology for changing others. Instead of waiting for others to change or waiting for the situation to change, you take the first step forward yourself.

If the person seems to be happy, one can frankly celebrate that condition. That is love. Relationships in which people restrict each other eventually fall apart.

The kind of relationship that feels somehow oppressive and strained when the two people are together cannot be called love, even if there is passion. When one can think, *Whenever I am with this person, I can behave very freely*, one can really feel love. One can be in a calm and quite natural state, without having feelings of inferiority or being beset with the need to flaunt one's superiority. That is what real love is like. Restriction, on the other hand, is a manifestation of the mind-set of attempting to control one's partner, and also an idea founded on a sense of distrust. Being in the same space with someone who distrusts you isn't a natural situation that one can put with, is it? As Adler says, "If two people want to live together on good terms, they must treat each other as equal personalities."

The worst thing to do is to just stand still with the situation as it is.

In Adlerian psychology, self-reliance as an individual and cooperation within society are put forth as overarching objectives.

### Don't Fall for the "Life-Lie"

It isn't that you dislike Mr. A because you can't forgive his flaws. You had the goal of taking a dislike to Mr. A beforehand and then started looking for the flaws to satisfy that goal. So that you could avoid an interpersonal relationship with Mr. A.

Adler called the state of coming up with all manner of pretexts in order to avoid the life tasks the "life-lie." One shifts one's responsibility for situation one is currently in to someone else. One is running away from one's life tasks by saying that everything is the default of other people, or the fault of one's environment. It's exactly the same as with the story I mentioned earlier about the female student with the fear of blushing. One lies to oneself, and one lies to the people around one, too. When you really think about it, it's a pretty severe term.

Even if you are avoiding your life tasks and clinging to your life-lies, it isn't because you are steeped in evil. It is not an issue to be condemned from a moralistic standpoint. It is only an issue of courage.

### From the Psychology of Possession to the Psychology of Practice

Adlerian psychology is not a "psychology of possession" but a "psychology of use." It's not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.

## The third night: Discard Other People's Tasks

### Deny the Desire for Recognition

human values and human happiness cannot be bought with money.

if one become able to see others as one's comrades, one's way of looking at the world should change as well.

Adlerian psychology denies the need to seek recognition from others.

### Do Not Live to Satisfy the Expectations of Others

Being recognized by others is certainly something to be happy about. But it would be wrong to say that being recognized is absolutely necessary.

If one takes appropriate action, one receives praise. If one takes inappropriate action, one receives punishment. Adler was very critical of education by reward and punishment. It leads to mistaken lifestyle in which people think, *If no one is going to praise me, I won't take appropriate action* and *If no one is going to punish me, I'll engage in inappropriate actions,* too.

Wanting to be recognized by people you like, to be accepted by people close to you, is a normal desire.

You are badly mistaken. Look, we are not living to satisfy other people's expectations.

When one seeks recognition from others, and concerns oneself only with how one is judged by others, in the end, one is living other people's lives.

Wishing so hard to be recognized will lead to a life of following expectations held by other people who want you to be "this kind of person." In other words, you throw away who you really are and live other people's lives. And please remember this: If you are not living to satisfy other people's expectations, it follows that other people are not living to satisfy your expectations. Someone might not act the way you want him to, but it doesn't do to get angry. That's only natural.

When trying to be recognized by others, almost all people treat satisfying other people's expectations as the means to that end. And that is in accordance with the stream of thought of reward-and-punishment education that says one will be praised if one takes appropriate action. If, for example, the main point of your job turns out to be satisfying other people's expectations, then that job is going to be very hard on you. Because you'll always be worried about other people looking at you and fear their judgment, and you are repressing your "I-ness." So, in a good way, they can't behave in a self-centered fashion.

### How to Separate Tasks

All interpersonal relationship troubles are caused by intruding on other people's tasks, or having one's own tasks intruded on. Carrying out the separation of tasks is enough to change one's interpersonal relationships dramatically.

There is a simple way to tell whose task it is. Think, *Who ultimately is going to receive the result brought about by the choice that is made*? When the child has made the choice of not studying, ultimately, the result of that decision - not being able to keep up in class or to get into the preferred school, for instance - does not have to be received by the parents. Clearly, it is the child who has to receive it. In other words, studying is the child's task.

As a result of having received counseling, what kind of resolution does the client make? To change his lifestyle, or not. That is the client's task, and the counselor cannot intervene.

Remember the old saying, "You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink." Forcing change while ignoring the person's intentions will only lead to an intense reaction.

You are the only one who can change yourself.

### Discard Other People's Tasks

However, no matter how much of the burden of the child's task one carries, the child is still an independent individual. Children do not become what their parents want them to become. In their choices of university, place of employment, and partner in marriage, and even in the everyday subtleties of speech and conduct, they do not act according to their parents' wishes.

You believe in your partner; that is your task. But how that person acts with regard to your expectations and trust is other people's tasks. When you push your wishes without having drawn that line, before you know it you're engaging in stalker-like intervention. Suppose your partner did not act as you had wished. Would you still be able to believe in that person? Would you still be able to love that person? The task of love that Adler speaks of is composed of such questions.

Intervening in other people's tasks and taking on other people's tasks turns one's life into something heavy and full of hardship. If you are leading a life of worry and suffering - which stems from interpersonal relationships - learn the boundary of "From here, that is not my task." And discard other people's tasks. That is the first step toward lightening the load and making life simpler.

### How to Rid Yourself of Interpersonal Relationship Problems

All you can do with regard to your own life is choose the best path that you believe in. On the other hand, what kind of judgment do other people pass on that choice? That is the task of other people, and is not a matter you can do anything about.

What another person thinks of you - if he or she likes you or dislikes you - that is that person's task, not mine. That is separating is. You are worried about other people looking at you. You are worried about being judged by other people. That is why you are constantly craving recognition from others. Now, why are you worried about other people looking at you, anyway? Adlerian psychology has an easy answer. You haven't done the separation of tasks yet. You assume that even things that should be other people's tasks of tasks are your own. Remember the word s of the grandmother: "You're the only one who's worried how you look." Her remark drives right to the heart of the separation of tasks. What other people think when they see your face - that is the task of other people and is not something you have any control over.

I can't do my work because I've been shunned by my boss. It's the boss's fault that my work isn't gong well. The person who says such things is bringing up the existence of the boss as an excuse for the work that doesn't go well. Much like the female student with the fear of blushing, it's actually that you need the existence of an awful boss. Because the you can say, "If only I didn't have this boss, I could get more work done."

First, one should ask, "whose task is this?" Then do the separation of tasks. Calmly delineate up to what point one's own task go, and from what point they become another person's task. And do not intervene in one's own tasks. This is a specific and revolutionary viewpoint that is unique to Adlerian psychology and contains the potential to utterly change one's inter personal relationship problems.

### Cut the Gordian Knot

One should be ready to lend a hand when needed but not encroach on the person's territory. It is important to maintain this kind of moderate distance.

Children who have not been taught to confront challenge will try to avoid all challenges.

### Desire for Recognition Makes You Unfree

It is not so difficult to judge what others expect of one, or what kind of role is being demanded of one. Living as one likes, on the other hand, is extremely difficult. What does one want? What does one want to become, what king of life does one want to lead? One doesn't always get such a concrete idea of thing. It would be grave mistake to think that everyone has clear-cut dreams and objectives.

Maybe it is easier to live in such a way to satisfy other people's expectations. Because one is entrusting one's own life to them. For example, one runs along the tracks that one's parents have laid out .Even of there  a lot of things one might object to, one will not lose one's way as long as one stays on those rails. But if one is deciding one's path oneself, it's only natural that one will get lose at times. One comes up against the wall of "how one should live."

To aspire to be recognized by others and live an honest life. Other people's eyes are my guide.

To live one's life trying to gauge other people's feelings and being worried about how they look at you. To live in such a way that others' wishes are granted. There may indeed be signposts to guide you this way, but it is a very unfree way to live. Now , why are you choosing such an unfree way to live? You are using the term "desire for recognition," but what you  are really saying is that you don't want to be disliked by anyone.

It is true that there is no person who wishes to be disliked. But look at it this way: What should one do to not be disliked by anyone? There is only one answer: It is constantly gauge other people's feelings while swearing loyalty to all of them. If there are ten people, one must swear loyalty to all of ten. When one does that, for the time being one will have succeeded in not being disliked by anyone. But at this point, there is a great contradiction looming. One swears loyalty to all ten people out of the single-minded desire to not be disliked. 

If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy other people's expectations, and one is entrusting one's own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to oneself and continuing that lying to include that people around one.

### What Real Freedom Is

Real freedom is an attitude akin to pushing up one's tumbling self from below.

A stone is powerless. Once it has begun to roll downhill, it will continue to roll until released from the natural laws of gravity and inertia. But we are not stones. We are beings who are capable of resisting inclination. We can stop our tumbling selves and climb uphill. The desire for recognition is probably a natural desire. S are you going to keep rolling downhill in order to receive recognition from others? Are you gong swear yourself down like a rolling stone, until everything is smoothed away? When all that is left is a little round ball, would that be "the real I"? It cannot be.

In Adlerian psychology, we think that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. In other words, we seek release from interpersonal relationships. We seek to be free from interpersonal relationships. However, it is absolutely impossible to live all alone in the universe. In light of what we have discussed until now, the conclusion we reach should be that "freedom is being disliked by other people."

It is certainly distressful to be disliked. If possible, one would like t olive without being disliked by anyone. One want to satisfy one's desire for recognition. But conducting oneself in such a way as to not be disliked by anyone is an extremely unfree way of living, and is also impossible. There is a cost incurred when one wants to exercise one's freedom. And the cost of freedom in interpersonal relationship is that one is disliked by other people.

Unless one is unconcerned by other people's judgments, had no fear of being disliked by other people, and pays the cost that one might never be recognized, one will never be able to follow through in one's own way of living. That is to say, one will not be able to be free.

Not wanting to be disliked is probably my task, but whether or not so-and-so dislike me is the other person's task. Even if there is a person who doesn't think well of me, I cannot intervene in that. To borrow from the proverb I mentioned earlier, naturally one would make the effort to lead someone to water, but whether he drinks or not is that person's task.

The courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. When you have gained that courage, your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into things of lightness.

### You Hold the Cards to Interpersonal Relationships

But to think to myself, *He bit me that time, and that is why our relationship went bad*, is a Freudian etiological way of thinking. The Adlerian teleology position completely reverses the causes-and-effect interpretation. That is to say, I brought out the memory of being hit because I don't want my relationship with my father to get better.

Even though, how does it actually change things? It doesn't change the fact that you were hit in childhood, right?

One can think from the viewpoint that it is an interpersonal relationship card. As long as I use etiology to think, It is because he hit me that I have a bad relationship with my father, it would be a matter that was impossible for me to do anything about. But if I can think, I brought out the memory of being hit because I don't want my relationship with my father to get better, then I will be holding the card to repair relations. Because if I can just change the goal, that fixes everything.

However, at the time of making my resolution to repair relations, it did not matter to me what sort of lifestyle my father had, or what he thought of me, of the kind of attitude he might adopt in response to my approach - such things didn't matter at all. Even if there were no intention to repair relations on his side, I would not mind in the least. The issue was whether or not I would resolve to do it, and I was always holding the interpersonal relationships cards.

Many people think that the interpersonal relationship cards are held by the other person. That is why they wonder, *How does that person feel about me?* and end up living in such a way as to satisfy the wishes  of other people. But if they can grasp the separation of tasks, they will notice that they are holding the cards. That is a new way of thinking.

Even I change, it is only "I" who changes. I do not know what will happen to the other person as a result, and that is not an aspect I can take part in. This too is the separation of tasks. Of course, there times when, in tandem with my change - not due to my change - the other person changes too. In many cases, that person will have no choice but to change. But that is not the goal, and it is certainly possible that the other person will not change. In my case, changing one's own speech and conduct as a way of manipulation other people is clearly a mistaken way of thinking.

## The Fourth Night: Where the Center of World Is

### Individual Psychology and Holism

If you take Adlerian psychology to its logical conclusion, it's basically saying, "I am I, and you are you," and leading people toward isolation. It's saying,"I won't interface with you, so don't interfere with me either, and we'll both go on living however we please." 

Please do not think of the separation of tasks as something that is meant to keep other people away; instead, see it as a way of thinking with which to unravel the threads of the complex entanglement of one's interpersonal relations. Right now, your threads and other people's threads are all tangled up in a confused mess, and you are looking at the world while in that condition. Red, blue, brown, and green-all that colors mixing together-you think of it as "connection." But it isn't.

The separating of tasks is actually the point of departure for interpersonal relations.

### The Goal of Interpersonal Relationships Is a Feeling of Community

If other people are our comrades, and we live surrounded by them, we should be able to find in that life our own place of "refuge." Moreover, in doing so, we should begin to have the desire to share with our comrades, to contribute to the community. The sense of others as comrades, this awareness of "having one's own refuge," is called "community feeling."

Adlerian psychology has the view that all problems are interpersonal relationship problems. Interpersonal relations are the source of unhappiness. And the opposite can be said, too - interpersonal relations are the source of happiness.

Community feeling is also referred to as "social interest," that is to say, "interest in society." The society's smallest unit is you and I, from the point of view of sociology.

### Why Am I Only Interested in Myself?

People who are incapable of carrying out the separation of tasks and who are obsessed with the desire for recognition are also extremely self-centered.

You want to be thought well of by others, and that is why you worry about the way they look at you. That is not concern for others. It is nothing but attachment to self.

### You Are Not the Center of the World

People who have concern only for themselves think that they are at the center of the world. To such people, others are merely "people who will do something for me." They half genuinely believe that everyone else exists to serve them and should give precedence to their feelings.

They make a leap from being "life's protagonist" to becoming "the world's protagonist." For this reason, whenever they come into contact with another person, all they can think is, *What will this person give me?* However - and this is something that does not hold true for princes and princesses - this expectation is not going to be satisfied on every occasion. Because other are not living to satisfy your expectations.

Then, when those expectations are not satisfied, they become deeply disillusioned and feel as if they have been horribly insulted. And they become resentful, and think, *That person didn't do anything for me. That person let me down. That person isn't my comrade anymore. He's my enemy*. People hold the belief that they are the center of the world always end up losing their comrades before long.

What happens when a globe is used to represent the world? Because with a globe, you can look at the world with France at the center, or China, or Brazil, for that matter. Every place is central, and no place is, at the same. The globe may be dotted with an infinite number of centers, in accordance with the viewer's location and angle of view. That is the nature of a globe.

### Listen to the Voice of a Large Community

Community feeling is having "a sense of others as comrades" and "an awareness of having one's own refuge" within the community.

Once you know how big the world is, you will see that all the hardship you went through in school was a storm in a teacup. The moment you leave the teacup, that raging storm will be gone, and a gentle breeze will great you in its place.

When we run into difficulties in our interpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way out, what we should consider first and foremost is the principle that says, "Listen to the voice of the larger community."

Living in fear of one's relationships falling apart is an unfree way to live, in which one is living for other people.

### Do Not Rebuke or Praise

In Adlerian psychology, we take the stance that in child-rearing, and in all other forms of communication with other people, one must not praise. One must not praise, and one must not rebuke. This is the standpoint of Adlerian psychology.

When one praises another, the goal is "to manipulate someone who has less ability than you." It is not done out of gratitude or respect.

Whether we praise or rebuke others, the only difference is one of the carrot or the stick, and the background goal is manipulation. The reason Adlerian psychology is highly critical of reward-and-punishment education is that its intention is to manipulate children.

The feeling of inferiority is an awareness that arises within vertical relationships. If one can build horizontal relationships that are "equal but not the same" for all people, there will no longer be any room for inferiority complexes to emerge.

### The Encouragement Approach

Why does a person intervene? Here, too, in the background, vertical relationships are at play. It is precisely because one perceives interpersonal relation as vertical, and sees the other party as beneath one, that one intervention. Through intervention, one tries to lead the other party in the desired direction. One has convinced oneself that one is right and that the other party is wrong. Of course, the intervention here is manipulation, pure and simple. Parents commanding a child to study is a typical example of this. They might be acting out of the best of intentions from their points of view, but when it comes down to it, the parents are intruding and attempting to manipulate the child to go in their desired direction.

The kind of assistance, which is based on horizontal relationships, is referred to in Adlerian psychology as "encouragement."

When one is not following through with one's tasks, it is not because one is without ability. Adlerian psychology tells us that the issue here is not one of ability but simply that "one has lost the courage to face one's tasks." And if that is the case, the thing to do before anything else is to recover that lost courage.

When one is praised by another person, one becomes truly aware of one's ability and regains one's courage. It is as a result of being praised that one becomes truly aware of one's ability.

You are wrong. Being praised is what leads people to form the belief that they have no ability. The more one is praised by another person, the more one forms the belief that one has no ability. Please do your best to remember this.

Even if you do derive joy from being praised, it is the same as being dependent on vertical relationships and acknowledging that you have no ability. Because giving praise is a judgment that is passed by a person of ability onto a person without ability.

When receiving praise becomes one's goal, one is choosing a way of living that is in line with another person's system of values. Looking at your life until now, aren't you tired of trying to live up to your parents' expectations.

First, do the separation of tasks. Then, while accepting each others' differences, build equal horizontal relationships. Encouragement is the approach that comes next.

### How to Feel You Have Value

You convey words of gratitude, saying thank you to this partner who has helped you with your work. You might express straightforward delight: "I'm glad." Or you could convey your thanks by saying, "That was a big help." This is an approach to encouragement that is based on horizontal relationships.

The most important thing is to not judge other people. "Judgment" is a word that comes out of vertical relationships. If one is building horizontal relationship, there will be words of more straightforward gratitude and respect and joy.

Being praised essentially means that one is receiving judgment from another person as "good." And the measure of what is good or bad about that action is that person's yardstick. If receiving praise is what on e is after, one will have no choice but to adapt to that person's yardstick and put the brakes on one's own freedom. "Thank you," on the other hand, rather than being judgment, is a clear expression of gratitude. When one hears words of gratitude, one knows that one has made a contribution to another person.

 What does a person have to do to get courage? In Adler's view, "It is only when a person is able to feel that he has worth that he can possess courage."

If one is able to feel one has worth, then one can accept oneself just as one is and have the courage to face one's tasks. So the issue that arises at this point is how on earth can one become able to feel one has worth.?

That one can act on the community, that is to say, on other people, and that one can feel "I am of use to someone." Instead of feeling judgment by another person as "good," being able to feel, by way of one's own subjective viewpoint, that "I can make contributions to other people." It is at that point that , at las, we can have a true sense of our own worth. Everything we have been discussing about community feeling and encouragement connects here.

### Exist in the Present

If you consider things at the level of being, we are of use to others and have worth just by being here.

If your life were in danger, and you were hanging on by a thread, the people around you would probably feel very gladdened just by the very fact of your existing. They would simply feel thankful that you are safe in the here and now, and would not being wanting you to perform some direct act. At the very last, there is no reason they would have to think that way. So instead of thinking of oneself on the level of acts, first of all one accepts oneself on the level of being.

"Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not."

### People Cannot Make Proper Use of Self

People can be of use to someone else simply by being alive, and have a true sense of their worth just by being alive.

I am alive, right here and now. "I," who is no one else but me, am alive right here. But even so, I don't really feel that I have worth.

Age does not matter in love and friendship. It is certainly true that the tasks of friendship require a steady courage. With regard to your relationship with me, it will be fine to reduce the distance little by little. To a degree of distance in which we are not in very close contact but can still reach out and touch each other's faces with our outstretched arms, so to speak.

## The Fifth Night: To Live in Earnest in the Here and Now

### Excessive Self-Consciousness Stifles the Self

You are saying that one has to stop being attached to the "I" and make the switch to "concern for others." I am sure it is exactly as you say - concern for others is important, I agree. But no matter what, we worry about ourselves; we look at ourselves all the time.

I am self-loathing realist. I hate who I am, and that's exactly why I look at myself all the time. I don't have confidence in myself, and that's why I am excessively self-conscious.

There is no need to rush the answers.

### Not Self-Affirmation - Self-Acceptance

Anyone can behave like a king when they're alone. So this is an issue that should be considered in the context of interpersonal relations. Because it isn't you don't have an innocent self - it is only that you can't do such things in front of others.

It's about community feeling, after all. Concretely speaking, it's making the switch from attachment to self ( self-interest) to concern for others ( social interest) and gaining a sense of community felling. Three things are needed at this point: "self-acceptance," "confidence in others," and "contribution to others."

With self-acceptance, if one cannot do something, one is simply accepting "one's incapable self" as is and moving forward so that one can do whatever one can. It sis not a way of lying to oneself. To put it more simply, say you've got a score of 60 percent, but you tell yourself, *I just happened to get unlucky this time around, and the real me is 100 percent*. That is self-affirmation. By contrast, if one accepts oneself as one is, as 60 percent, and thinks to oneself, *How should I go about getting closer to 100 percent?* - that is self-acceptance.

One cannot change what one is born with. But one can, under one's own power, go about changing what use one makes of that equipment. So in that case, one simply has to focus on what one can change, rather than on what one cannot. This is what I call self-acceptance.

> *Slaughterhouse-Five:*
>
> God grant me that serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can' and wisdom to know the difference.

We do not lack ability. We just lack courage. It all comes down to courage.

### The Difference Between Trust and Confidence

Resignation has the connotation of seeing clearly with fortitude and acceptance. Having a firm grasp on the truth of things - that is resignation. There is nothing pessimistic about it.

When one is switch from attachment to self to concern for others, the second key concept - confidence in others - becomes absolutely essential.

The basis of interpersonal relations is founded not on the trust but on confidence. It is doing without any set conditions whatsoever when believing in others. Even if one does not have sufficient objective grounds for trusting someone, one believes. One believes unconditionally without concerning oneself with such things as security. That is confidence.

And there are also times when someone deceives you, and you get used the way. But look at it from the standpoint of someone who has been taken advantage of . There are people who will continue to believe in you unconditionally even if you are the one who has taken advantage of them. People who will have confidence in you no matter how they are treated. Would you be able to betray such a person again and again?

Suppose that you have placed "doubt" at the foundation of your interpersonal relations. That you live your life doubting other people - doubting your friends and even your family and those you love. What sort of relationship could possibly arise from that ? The other person will detect the doubt in your eyes in an instant. He or she will have an instinctive understanding that "this person does not have confidence in me." Do you think one would be able to build some kind of positive relationship from that point? It is precisely because we lay a foundation of unconditional confidence that it is possible for us to build a deep relationship.

Right now, you are thinking, If I were to have confidence in someone unconditionally, I would just get taken advantage of. However, you not the one who decides whether or not to take advantage. That is the other person's task. All you need to do is think, what should I do? If you are telling yourself, I'll give it to him if he isn't going take advantage of me, it is just a relationship of trust that is based on security or conditions.

As I have stated repeatedly, carrying out the separation of tasks returns life to an astonishingly simple form. But while the principle of the separation of tasks is easy to grasp, putting it into practice is difficult.



To see the world, things dangerous to come to.

To see behind walls, to draw closer.

To find each other and to feel.

That is the purpose of life.

### The Essence of Work Is a Contribution to the Common Good

Community feeling is not something that is attainable with just self-acceptance and confidence in others. It is at this point that the third key concept - contribution to others - becomes necessary.

### Young People Walk Ahead of Adults

The two objectives for behavior: to be self-reliant and to live in harmony with society. The two objectives for the psychology that supports these behaviors: the consciousness that *I have the ability* and the consciousness that *people are my comrades*.

### Workaholism Is a Life-Lie

To be sure, not everyone in the world is a good and virtuous person.

Even though the problem is really that one had not attained self-acceptance or confidence in others, or contribution to others. for that matter, one is focusing on only one tiny part of things that simply should no matter and from that trying to form judgments with regard to the entire world.

### You Can Be Happy Now

Those who hear my talk today can be happy right now, this very instant. But those who do not will never be able to be happy.

For a human being, the greatest unhappiness is not being able to like oneself. Adler came up with an extremely simple answer to address this reality. Namely, that the feeling of "I am beneficial to the community" or "I am of use to someone" is the only thing that can give one a true awareness that one has worth.

You are not the one who decides if your contributions are of use. That is the task of other people, and is not an issue in which you can intervene. In principle, there is not even any way you can know whether you have really made a contribution. That is to say, when we are engaging in this contribution to others, the contribution does not have to be a visible one - all we need is the subjective sense that "I am of use to someone," or in other words, a feeling of contribution.

Happiness is the feeling of contribution. That is the definition of happiness.

So you are saying that the reason I am not happy is that I don't have a feeling of contribution?

### Two Paths Traveled by Those Wanting to Be "Special Beings" 

Whether they are trying to be especially good, or trying to be especially bad, the goal is the same: to attract the attention of other people, get of the "normal" condition and become a "special being." That is their only goal.

One makes trouble for another person while trying at the same time to be "special."

### The Courage to Be Normal 

Why is it necessary to be special? Probably because one cannot accept one's normal self. And it is precisely for this reason that when being especially good becomes a lost cause, one makes the huge leap to being especially bad - the opposite extreme. But is being normal, being ordinary, really such a bad thing? Is it something inferior? Or, in truth, isn't everybody normal? It is necessary to think this through to its logical conclusion.

Self-acceptance is the vital first step. If you are able to possess the courage to be normal, your way of looking at the world will change dramatically.

### Life Is a Series of Moments

If life were a line, then life planning would be possible. But our lives are only a series of dots. A well-planned life is not something to be treated as necessary or unnecessary, as it is impossible.

### Live Like You're Dancing

Since one is dancing, one does not stay in the same place. But there is no destination.

You should be on a journey the moment you step outside your home, and all the moments on the way to your destination should be a journey.

If the goal of climbing a mountain were to get to the top, that  would be a kinetic act. To take it to the extreme, it wouldn't matter if you went to the mountaintop in a helicopter, stayed there for five minutes or so, and then headed back in the helicopter again. Of course, if you didn't make it to the mountaintop, that would mean the mountain-climbing expedition was a failure. However, if the goal is mountain climbing itself, and not just getting to the top, one could say it is energetic. In this case, in the end of it it doesn't matter whether one makes it to the mountaintop or not.

### Shine a Light on the here and Now 

We should live more earnestly only here and now. The fact that you think you can see the past, or predict the future, is proof that rather than living earnestly here and now, you are living in a dim twilight. Life is a series of moments, and neither the past nor the future exists. You are trying to give yourself a way out by focusing on the past and the future. What happened in the past has nothing whatsoever to do with your here and now, and what the future may hold is not a matter of think about here and now. If you are living earnestly here and now, you will not be concerned with such things.

To shine a spotlight on here and now is to go about doing what one can do now, earnestly and conscientiously.

### The Greatest Life-Lie

Life is always simple, not something that one needs to get too serious about. If one is living each moment earnestly, there is no need to get too serious. And there is another thing I would like you to keep in mind: When one has adopted an energeial viewpoint, life is always complete. If your life, or mine, for hat matter, were to come to an end here and now, it would not do to refer to either of them as unhappy. The life that ends at the age of twenty and the life that ends at ninety are both complete lives, and lives of happiness.

The greatest life-lie of all is to not live here and now. It is to look at the past and the future, cast a dim light on one's entire life, and believe that one has been able to see something. Until now , you have turned away from the here and now and shone a light only on invented pasts and futures. You have told a great lie to your life, to these irreplaceable moments.

### Give Meaning to Seemingly Meaningless Life

Life in general has no meaning whatsoever. But you can assign meaning to that life. And you are the only one who can assign meaning to your life.

When one attempts to choose freedom, it is only natural that one may lose one's way. At this juncture, Adlerian psychology holds up a "guiding star" as a grand compass pointing to a life of freedom. Just like the traveler who relies on the North Star, in out lives we need a guiding stat. That is the Adlerian psychology way of thinking. It is an expansive ideal that says, as long as we do not lose sight of this compass and keep on moving in this direction, there is happiness. It is contribution to others.

No matter what moments you are living , or if there are people who dislike you, as long as you do not lose sight of the guiding star of "I contribute to others." you will not lose your way, and  you can do whatever you like. Whether you're disliked or not, you pay it no mind and live free.

Let's dance in earnest the moments of the here and now, and live in earnest. Do not look at the past, and do not look at the future. One lives each complete moment like a dance. There is no need to compete with anyone, and one has no use for destinations. As long as you are dancing, you will get somewhere.

When you have danced here and now in earnest and to the full, that is when the meaning of your life will become clear to you.

Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: You should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.

I cannot tell yet if it is I who have changed, or if it is the world that I can see from that vantage point that has changed. But there is one thing I can say with conviction:  Here and now is shining brightly! Yes, it is so bright that I can see almost nothing of tomorrow.

### Afterword

In its original meaning, philosophy refers not to "wisdom" itself but to "love of wisdom," and it is the very process of learning what one does not know and arriving at wisdom that is important. Whether or not one attains wisdom in the end is not an issue.
