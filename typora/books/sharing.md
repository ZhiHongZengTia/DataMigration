## First Step

It is the first day that I use it to record my reading and life. I would appreciate it so much if I get it into a habit. Just as Mrs. Ma effect goes, it is never to late to pursuit what you love. I have much feeling to share with others, but I am unable to do it, as I am excessively self-conscious, and I think like *If I share my feelings with my friends in WeChat or QQ, they'll probably laugh at me and think I'm strange*.

In all, what I need is courage, encouragement, confidence, changes, enthusiasm and so on. From now on, I want to see the power of myself and time.
