# Stop Talking, Start Influencing

## 12 insights from brain science to make your message stick

### Introduction

Here's the problem: despite the fact that many of us spend time each and every day disseminating knowledge to others, very few of us have ever been schooled in how best to pass along this knowledge so that others can understand, remember and apply it.

To get around this, many of us turn to books ( much like this one) that offer a plethora of tips and techniques we can use to make our teaching more effective. Surely, if we simply follow these 'how to' guides we should be able to inspire and influence those around us just like the greats.

Unfortunately, these guides almost never work. To understand why, take a look at the illustration opposite.

Now, if you're sick of repeating yourself ad nauseam to your colleagues and clients; if you've had enough of pouring your heart into presentations only to see no lasting impact among your audience, then settle in.

It's time to stop talking and start influencing.

## Text + Speech

What is reading, but silent conversation.

### The secret history of reading

### Twice the work, half the impact

Although we can listen to multiple people speaking at the same time, we can only truly understand one person speaking at a time. 

## Images + Speech

Not only can visual images and oral speech be processed simultaneously, but this combination will also assist the audience in interpreting, comprehending and learning the presented material.

How many images should I include on each slide?

More is not always better.

Simply being clear on your ultimate intention for an included image will help you determine how relevant that image needs to be to the words you're speaking.

## Space

A place for everything, everything in its place.

Ensure slides are consistently formatted.

PDFs and e-readers have a number of advantages over print ( the ability to change font size, the ability to search for keywords, backlighting for night reading, etc.). Thus, digital copies suit different purposes better than print. However, when it comes to learning and memory, print should be your medium of choice. 

## Context/State

In short, where we do out learning forms an integral aspect of what we ultimately learn. Researchers call this *context-dependent learning* and it's the reason why we don't always recognize con-workers when we bump into them outside the workplace, why certain smells can trigger vivid memories, and why returning to places form our childhood can bring back long-forgotten episodes.

A new  memory we form while happy, sad, angry, scared or disgusted will be infused with this emotion and easier to access in the future when in that same emotional state.

In short, how we feel during learning forms an integral aspect of what we ultimately learn. Researchers call this *state-dependent learning*, and it is the reason why sometimes we can't click into work until after the third latte, why some days we can't engage with a long-term project, and why we sometime screw up the simplest of tasks under high-pressure circumstances.



Help others hone their skills in the location they hope to perform in.

Help others hone their skills in multiple locations if they hope to broadly apply those skills.

It's often the case that people will procrastinate and cut off preparing for a performance until the day before (according to some surveys, 99 percent of students admit to only studying on the night before an exam ... and 1 percent of students are liars). 

## Multitasking

the power of attentaion

It's not multitasking, it's task-swithching. Although we often think we're multitasking, never do we actually undertake multiple tasks simultaneously. Rather, we really quickly jump back and forth between tasks, swapping out rulesets within the LatPFE each time we do.

It turns out that jumping between tasks has three major consequences.

1. Time
2. Accuracy
3. Memory (attempting to multi-task impairs memory formation)

This means that information learnt during multitasking is often stored as a habitual routine, making it incredibly difficult to consciously access and manipulate in the future (try describing the exact muscle movements you undertake in order to walk)/

Believe it or not, the better you rated your ability to multi-task, the worse a multi-tasker you likely are. Furthermore, the adage 'practice makes perfect' has little bearing on multitasking. In fact, people who frequently multi-task almost always perform worse during task-switching than people who rarely multi-task. To make matters worse, frequent multitasking strengthens people's confidence in their ability to task-switch ... which leads to more multitasking ... which leads to even higher confidence ... and so on.

### Ensure technology is integral

Many people employ technology with little rhyme or reason. Every student gets a laptop; every session is streamed on-line; every discussion occurs via digital message-boards. The sentiment seems to be that 'If there's a computer involved, people must be learning'.

Avoid unfinished problems and premature questions.

## Interleave

Teach first, interleave second.
